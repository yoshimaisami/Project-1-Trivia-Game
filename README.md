## Reading Game

---

- Reading Game is a simple trivia game designed to help toddlers recognize and read words.

- The code is very basic, containing html, css and js files.

## How it Works

---

- Users are presented with pictures (questions), which they must match to corresponding words that appear on the screen.

[all pictures are from:](https://www.freepik.com)

- There are event listners keeping track of what options the Users click on, and compare the User provided answers against predefined object values. If the User selects the correct answer, a nextLevel function is envoked an trasitions the user to the next challenge. If the User provides the wrong answer, they recieve an alert which encourages them to try again, and keeps the User on the same gameLevel until they select the correct one.
